         <p><h3>Steps</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Preheat the oven to 200C/180C Fan/Gas 6. Stir the potatoes, leek, cheddar and herbs together in a large bowl. Season with salt and pepper.</li>
                <li>In a separate bowl, gradually whisk the milk into the cream cheese. Pour the milk mixture into the potato mixture, stirring together until well mixed. Tip into a roughly 31x23cm/12½x9in roasting tin.</li>
                <li>Open out the pastry sheet and lay the pastry on top of the pie filling, tucking the edges into the sides.</li>
                <li>Brush the top with milk and make a couple of slits in the pastry so the steam can escape.</li>
                <li>Bake for 30 minutes until puffed up and golden brown. Serve with the peas.</li>
